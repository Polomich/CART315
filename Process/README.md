## Week 2: Exploration Protoype I (January 29, 2025)

### How do you use Unity?

I tried to install Unity last week with multiple fails. I did not have it installed on time for the lab demo and had to leave class early for a meeting.  
Meaning I am on my owm for this.

I'm too scared to start a project from scratch but I saw that there are templates I can use under the education tab.  
I picked the platformer. Let's see what I can play around with.

Picking a script to go mess with.  
Why can't I edit in Unity.  
Oh that's just the inspector.

Oh no VS needs to install things. Oh that was fast.

Nevermind it's gonna take forever.

What is Awake, and why is not referenced anywhere?  
--> Initializer for an object.

1. First trial: changing the player color. That should be easy.
- can't find where the player color is stored.
- gonna try something else.

Insight: The player color is not set by code by image.  
Insight Correction: the player is a white colored sprite. Yet to find where the turquoise color comes from. 

2. Make the player bounce on Initialization.
- Found where the player Awakes
- The jumping methods look complicated
- I made the player Bounce!

Insight: Awake() is an initialization method in Unity. There is velocity math involved in jumping and moving around.  

3. Make the player bounce a certain amount of times using a for loop.  
<img width="593" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9635f97-4fc4-48a8-a708-acd77b852b36" />

As seen by my documentation, it did not work very well.

Insights: Awake() cannot contain a loop. ThreadSleep() does not work in Unity. 

<img width="543" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbc260f-0d3c-449e-b45c-cfaababb5492" />

Insights correction: the loop is not the problem. WaitForSecond returns something but the return type of Awake() is void so it's not compatible.  

<img width="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6bcb6d-87f5-4dda-9aa9-36bf11585b8a" />  

This also didn't work.  
Maybe changing it to real seconds?  
<img width="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65423f58-70b2-4f5f-a54e-87a80e661da4" />

This also did not work.

After inserting a bunch of print statements, I figured JumpingJacks was not being reached. Maybe I'm not calling it right?

<img width="611" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad917c9d-e0ea-4620-b1d9-6bcfe737a52e" />

Still not working.

<img width="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bf70d7a-1d77-4012-a783-7773f39438f2" />

So none of that worked bc it needs to be inside of a Coroutine. What the hell is a Coroutine.

<img width="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f410c316-d8ae-428f-9f1d-9726829d7e61" />

YESSSSS GORGEOUS DAY  
ITS ALIVE!!!!!!!!!

4. Time to try something else. Bounce with WaitUntil() to perfect it.

<img width="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f67272d5-b3a4-440e-8089-4b6dc5fd1be0" />

This worked but the player only jumped twice. It did jump as soon as it hit the ground.  
Need to try adding more jumps and more velocity.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02572595-c463-427f-b0e4-0510d36192e3)

Player jumps high, but only 3 times. Does my iterator continue on its own while player is jumping? Is the velocity not strong enough to bounce again?

<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0da07acb-205b-4b01-8e14-6a227b61ea28" />   
<img width="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ded57f-b879-4bb2-9e13-c00dced46b63" />

Every jump, the iterator goes up a few times.

This while loop did not change the outcome.


## Week 1: Make a tiny game (January 23, 2025)

### How do you make a game with an engine you've never used?

I started by opening Twin.
I thought the process of creating new things would be intuitive.
I mean, there are buttons to create new passages.
Why can't I connect anything???

Time to look for instructions.
I cannot find where is the Cookbook. I am exactly where on the page that I was directed to open.
After some more snooping (and actually opening the window in fullscreen) I found the tab for starting out.

Ooo I can make thins bold! This will come in handy.
I made my first connection. I this point, I'm not entirely sure where I want my story to go.

![img1](Images/Screenshot1.png)

I make the simplest thing I know.
Waking up.
Within the first few minutes of consciousness every morning, I am already making decisions.

![img2](Images/Screenshot2.png)

Testing to see how it looks.
I like it.
I do not know what all the variables at the bottom of the screen are. They will be a future problem, once I figure out this engine.
Usually, I would've already started messing with the HTML and styling. But learning from my past mistakes (and being told often that I'm focusing on the wrong thig) I'm going to write before I do the visuals.

![img3](Images/Screenshot3.png)

The options are also working fine.

![img4](Images/Screenshot4.png)

So far the tree isn't too complicated.
But I didnâ€™t realize that I 2 options named the same way would point to the same place.
That is troublesome. I have to find a way to differentiate them.

![img5](Images/Screenshot5.png)

I don't like that I have to rename my squares, but it does push me to come up with more creative ways to name them.

![img6](Images/Screenshot6.png)

I'm thinking of the options as I type them. Trying to keep everything organized.
The squares are in arranged in columns where the actions are similar. For examples of the different ways to catch a bus are in the same column but all belong to different roads. When a story option doesn't progress much (or there is only 1 option) the following square is added right below the previous.

![img7](Images/Screenshot7.png)

Here I am testing out so routes. For some reason, this option leads to nowhere even though the plan clearly shows that there is a following.

![img8](Images/Screenshot8.png)

I forgot to refresh the browser. Moving on. Nothing to see here.

![img9](Images/Screenshot9.png)

After testing out all the routes, I realized that refreshing the page or clicking the arrows to get to the beginning is too much effort. I added a final state that will help loop back to the start.

![img10](Images/Screenshot10.png)

The final game is just a short story that shows how there really isn't a happy ending. All options have their drawbacks. It is based on my Thursday mornings. They are hell. I can either get a bit more sleep but be late and hungry to class. Or waking up on time but be in pain from sleep deprivation.

### Play Testing

Game got play tested in class by 1 person.

Subject played the game over and over until they got all the routes.
Subject reported that they expected there to be a perfect ending --> BUT that does not indicate that this is a bad game. It is just what they are used to.

I told them that there isn't one. This game is based on my life. Life isn't perfect. I am in pain every Thursday.
There isn't a perfect ending because I myself don't know how to get there. Let me know if you figure it out.

### Where to find it
- the raw HTML file on GitHub: https://github.com/Polomich/CART315/blob/main/Games/Morning.html
- play the game directly on itch.io: https://polomich.itch.io/morning
