## Week 1: Make a tiny game (January 23, 2025)

### How do you make a game with an engine you've never used?

I started by opening Twin.
I thought the process of creating new things would be intuitive.
I mean, there are buttons to create new passages.
Why can't I connect anything???

Time to look for instructions.
I cannot find where is the Cookbook. I am exactly where on the page that I was directed to open.
After some more snooping (and actually opening the window in fullscreen) I found the tab for starting out.

Ooo I can make thins bold! This will come in handy.
I made my first connection. I this point, I'm not entirely sure where I want my story to go.

I make the simplest thing I know.
Waking up.
Within the first few minutes of consciousness every morning, I am already making decisions.

Testing to see how it looks.
I like it.
I do not know what all the variables at the bottom of the screen are. They will be a future problem, once I figure out this engine.
Usually, I would've already started messing with the HTML and styling. But learning from my past mistakes (and being told often that I'm focusing on the wrong thig) I'm going to write before I do the visuals.

The options are also working fine.

So far the tree isn't too complicated.
But I didnâ€™t realize that I 2 options named the same way would point to the same place.
That is troublesome. I have to find a way to differentiate them.

I don't like that I have to rename my squares, but it does push me to come up with more creative ways to name them.

I'm thinking of the options as I type them. Trying to keep everything organized.
The squares are in arranged in columns where the actions are similar. For examples of the different ways to catch a bus are in the same column but all belong to different roads. When a story option doesn't progress much (or there is only 1 option) the following square is added right below the previous.

Here I am testing out so routes. For some reason, this option leads to nowhere even though the plan clearly shows that there is a following.

I forgot to refresh the browser. Moving on. Nothing to see here.

After testing out all the routes, I realized that refreshing the page or clicking the arrows to get to the beginning is too much effort. I added a final state that will help loop back to the start.

The final game is just a short story that shows how there really isn't a happy ending. All options have their drawbacks. It is based on my Thursday mornings. They are hell. I can either get a bit more sleep but be late and hungry to class. Or waking up on time but be in pain from sleep deprivation.

### Play Testing

Game got play tested in class by 1 person.

Subject played the game over and over until they got all the routes.
Subject reported that they expected there to be a perfect ending --> BUT that does not indicate that this is a bad game. It is just what they are used to.

I told them that there isn't one. This game is based on my life. Life isn't perfect. I am in pain every Thursday.
There isn't a perfect ending because I myself don't know how to get there. Let me know if you figure it out.
